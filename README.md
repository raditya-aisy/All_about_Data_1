# Data Analysis Tasks

Hello! My name is Muhammad Raditya Aisy Dharmawan with Telkom Univ. identity number 1101204470.

Today is my first time working with data, and I'm trying this exercise in the course Learning Statistics & Optimization taught by Syamsul Rizal (SZL).

## Task Order 1

From the data collected, find:

- 10 players scoring the most goals
- 10 players with the longest playing time
- 10 players with the most assists
- 4 top goalscoring players from Manchester City team
- Which team is the top goal scorer from
- How many yellow and red cards has the top assist maker received?
- Who has the most assists and goals and from which team?
- 5 teams that have scored the most goals
- Sort the players by the most number of goals without getting any cards!

## Task Order 2

1. **Data Analysis from data0.csv**
   
Calculate and store the following statistics for each column in a new dataset:

- Mean
- Standard deviation
- Skewness
- Median
- Energy
- Min
- Max
  
2. **Plot Signals**
   
Plot the signals using a multiplot 2x3 layout. Choose 6 columns randomly.

3. **Scatterplot for Mean vs. Standard Deviation:**
Plot a scatterplot for the results from Task 1.

- Differentiate colors and markers for every 10 columns:
  - Columns 1-10: Red color, asterisk marker
  - Columns 11-20: Blue color, circle marker
  - Columns 21-30: Green color, triangle-down marker

Detail : 
- X-axis: Mean value
- Y-axis: Standard deviation value
       
4. **Scatterplot for Skewness vs. Median:**
Repeat the same process as Task 3

Detail : 
- X-axis: Mean value
- Y-axis: Standard deviation value
